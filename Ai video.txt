Create a 10–12 second looping hero-section video for a Facebook & Instagram Ads Agency.  
The style should be futuristic, high-tech, and data-driven, matching a dark navy blue gradient background with neon blue and purple accents.

Scene 1 (0–3 sec):
- Start with a smooth reveal of glowing 3D analytics dashboards and charts.
- Include animated graphs rising, KPI counters increasing, and marketing metrics growing.
- Add subtle glowing particle effects in the background.
- Show minimal text overlay: “High-Converting Ads That Scale Your Business”.

Scene 2 (3–6 sec):
- Bring in UI elements from Facebook Ads Manager and Instagram Ads (no logos fully, just stylized interfaces).
- Animate ad preview cards sliding in with smooth motion.
- Show a mock ROAS bar increasing, lead counts rising, and cost-per-result improvements.
- Text overlay: “Data-Driven Strategy. Real Results.”

Scene 3 (6–9 sec):
- Transition into neon 3D screens floating in space, showing dashboards, lead forms, ad creatives, and engagement icons.
- Add soft glow reflection effects and light streak transitions.
- Text overlay: “Grow Faster. Scale Smarter.”

Scene 4 (9–12 sec):
- End with the agency branding appearing in the center.
- Display: “VarniElevate Media”
- Beneath it: “Facebook & Instagram Ads Specialists”
- Keep background animated with subtle moving gradients and floating data elements.
- Ensure the video loops smoothly.

Overall Style:
- Futuristic, premium, agency-grade look.
- Neon blue, cyan, purple color palette.
- Smooth motion graphics, crisp UI animations, and high-energy techno feel.
- No people, no talking head — only digital UI, analytics, ads, dashboards, and futuristic holographic elements.

Audio:
- Soft, upbeat, modern techno background music (optional).

Output:
- 1080p or 4K video.
- Seamless loop for website hero section.
